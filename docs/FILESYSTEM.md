# Filesystem architecture

This document is a ChatGPT draft. It is meant to capture the current intended design, not a
final specification.

UniLANCE uses a Linux-like filesystem split into two partitions:

- `system`: immutable, replaced as a whole during system updates
- `data`: writable, preserved across updates except when migrations or an explicit reset say
  otherwise

The intended model is similar to immutable Linux systems such as Fedora Silverblue, or modern
macOS system/data separation:

- the base system image is read-only from firmware code
- persistent mutable state lives elsewhere
- local overrides and user data survive normal system replacement

## Design rules

- keep the logical directory layout as UNIX-like as possible
- keep shipped defaults in the immutable `system` partition
- keep persistent writable state in the `data` partition
- store normal config/state as compact `.pc` files
- use `.toml` only for sparse developer overrides of hidden or unsafe options
- never use TOML as the primary storage format for ordinary settings

## High-level layout

The runtime should look roughly like this:

```text
/
├── etc
│   └── override.d
│       ├── balance.toml
│       ├── imu.toml
│       ├── motor.toml
│       └── unsafe.toml
├── tmp
├── usr
│   ├── lib
│   │   └── unilance

        └── update
```

## Partition backing

- `system` backs `/usr/...`
- `data` backs `/etc/...` and `/var/...`
- `/run` and `/tmp` are volatile

In other words:

- `/usr` is firmware-owned and replaced on system update
- `/etc` is local administrator or developer override space
- `/var` is persistent mutable state

## Why `/etc` is small here

On UniLANCE, `/etc` is not the main place where normal settings live.

Normal config and state are stored in `.pc` files under `/var/lib/unilance`, because:

- they are compact
- they are typed
- they are easier to validate
- they are a better fit for app-driven editing on embedded storage

TOML files in `/etc/override.d` exist only to create friction around hidden, expert-only, or
unsafe settings.

If a setting can be safely edited by the consumer UI, it should generally not require a TOML
file at all.

## File-by-file meaning

### `/etc`

`/etc/override.d/`
- developer-only sparse overrides
- intended for hidden, advanced, or unsafe knobs
- missing file or missing key means no override

`/etc/override.d/motor.toml`
- advanced motor-control overrides

`/etc/override.d/balance.toml`
- advanced balancing algorithm overrides

`/etc/override.d/imu.toml`
- advanced IMU and estimation overrides

`/etc/override.d/unsafe.toml`
- intentionally high-friction overrides for options that can reduce safety margins or damage
  hardware

### `/usr/lib/unilance`

These are immutable machine-readable defaults shipped in the system image.

`/usr/lib/unilance/system.pc`
- top-level immutable system defaults for the target or model

`/usr/lib/unilance/control-defaults.pc`
- immutable defaults for the control subsystem

`/usr/lib/unilance/supervisor-defaults.pc`
- immutable defaults for the supervisor subsystem

`/usr/lib/unilance/profiles-defaults.pc`
- immutable stock ride profiles shipped with the system image

`/usr/lib/unilance/schema.pc`
- schema/version information used for migration decisions

`/usr/lib/unilance/build.pc`
- build metadata for the installed system image, such as version, target, or compatibility

### `/usr/share/unilance`

These are immutable human-facing assets.

`/usr/share/unilance/assets/`
- UI and static product assets

`/usr/share/unilance/docs/`
- packaged on-device documentation or reference material, if desired

`/usr/share/unilance/profiles/`
- optional unpacked stock profile resources if they need to exist as individual files

### `/var/lib/unilance`

These are writable persistent machine-owned files.

`/var/lib/unilance/settings.pc`
- main writable settings blob used by the UI and app for ordinary settings

`/var/lib/unilance/calib.pc`
- calibration data such as IMU offsets, current-sensor offsets, hall data, and similar learned
  parameters

`/var/lib/unilance/counters.pc`
- odometer-like counters, maintenance counters, or other monotonic stats

`/var/lib/unilance/state.pc`
- last-known operational state that is worth restoring but is not exactly user settings

`/var/lib/unilance/profiles.pc`
- writable user-created or user-modified profiles

`/var/lib/unilance/selected-profile.pc`
- active profile selection

`/var/lib/unilance/machine.pc`
- local machine-specific writable metadata that does not belong in OTP, such as provisioning
  side data or non-critical local identity metadata

`/var/lib/unilance/migrations.pc`
- migration bookkeeping and applied-schema history

### `/var/log`

`/var/log/debug.log`
- persistent debug log for troubleshooting

`/var/log/fault.log`
- persistent fault/event log intended for service diagnostics and user-visible fault presence

`/var/log/boot.log`
- boot and early-startup log

### `/var/spool/update`

`/var/spool/update/`
- staging area for update payloads before verification and installation

### Volatile paths

`/tmp`
- temporary files safe to discard on reboot

## Config precedence

Runtime config should be constructed in this order:

1. immutable defaults from `/usr/lib/unilance/*.pc`
2. writable persistent state from `/var/lib/unilance/*.pc`
3. sparse developer overrides from `/etc/override.d/*.toml`

That means:

- `.pc` files are the primary source of truth for normal operation
- TOML only overrides specific keys explicitly present in override files

## Override semantics

TOML overrides should follow these rules:

- sparse only; never write full config snapshots there
- absent file means no override
- absent key means no override
- invalid keys or values must be rejected and logged clearly
- consumer-facing tools should not edit these files
- developer tools may edit these files behind an explicit expert mode

Overrides should still pass through the same validation rules as app-written settings.

## Profiles

Profiles should not primarily live as TOML files.

Recommended split:

- stock profiles in immutable `.pc` defaults under `/usr/lib/unilance/profiles-defaults.pc`
- user-created or modified profiles in `/var/lib/unilance/profiles.pc`
- active selection in `/var/lib/unilance/selected-profile.pc`

This makes profiles compact, app-friendly, and easy to preserve across updates.

## Update behavior

Normal system update behavior should be:

- replace `system` as a whole
- preserve `data`
- run migrations if the schema version changes

In practice this means:

- `/usr/...` is replaced by the new system image
- `/etc/...` and `/var/...` are kept unless migration or reset says otherwise

## Security-sensitive data

The firmware entitlement blob used for official encrypted updates should live in a dedicated
sensitive location in writable storage, not mixed casually with normal user-facing config.

That design is described in `docs/SECURE_BOOT_AND_KEYS.md`.

## Variants

Target variants should be represented as different immutable system defaults, not different
binaries.

That means a target variant is mainly a different `system` image, especially different
contents under `/usr/lib/unilance/*.pc`.

## Summary

The intended UniLANCE filesystem model is:

- immutable `system` partition for shipped defaults and assets
- writable `data` partition for state, logs, calibration, and user-managed content
- `.pc` as the primary format for normal config and state
- `.toml` used only for sparse expert overrides in `/etc/override.d`
- Linux-like logical layout with `/usr`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/run`, and `/tmp`
